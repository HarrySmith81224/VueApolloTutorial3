Open an empty folder in Visual Studio Code and open a new terminal.

In the terminal run the following prompt to install vue/cli, this will be needed to install further components.

```code
    npm install -g @vue/cli
```

this installation will take some time, but once it is completed we will be able to create a Vue application.

to do this, run the following prompt.

```code
   vue create vueapolloapp
```

the last part is the name of the app which will be created, for this we have chosen 'vueapolloapp' but you may name it what ever you like. (names with capital letters are not accepted)



after running this, a menu will appear.

```code
   Vue CLI v5.0.8
    ? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
    > Default ([Vue 3] babel, eslint)       
    Default ([Vue 2] babel, eslint)       
    Manually select features 
```

Choose the default option of Vue 3 by pressing Enter.

If it is created successfully the following will display:
```code
    âš“  Running completion hooks...

    ðŸ“„  Generating README.md...

    ðŸŽ‰  Successfully created project vueapolloapp.
    ðŸ‘‰  Get started with the following commands:

    $ cd vueapolloapp
    $ npm run serve
 ```

 Run the two commands above, the first changes the directory to the new app, the second will run it.

 After running the serve command an http address will display, clicking this will open your new Vue app.

```code
    App running at:
    - Local:   http://localhost:8080/
```

Press control + C in the terminal to stop running the app.

Run this command to install the dependancies for apollo.
```code
    npm install --save graphql graphql-tag @apollo/client
```
Once completed, install the composition API.
```code
    npm install --save @vue/apollo-composable
```


At this point your app directory should look like this:
